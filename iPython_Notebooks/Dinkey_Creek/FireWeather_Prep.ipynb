The notebook imports from FireWeatherIndex_Calculations.py, a script originially written by Louise Loudermilk to convert time series of daily data into the LANDIS input files required by the Dynamic Fire and Fuels System extension. Here, we modify this script and set up a work flow to process RAWS data by year."

    "#### I chose to represent fire weather using RAWS data from each of the three fire regions represented in our simulation. The fire regions were defiend by Shuang et al., 2015, and were defined using elevation bins. FR1 is the lowest elevation region, and RAWS data from Batterson California were used to generate the fire weather (elvation = 963 m). FR2 is the middle elevation region, with fireweather derived from the Dinkey California station (elevation = 1727 m). FR3 is the high elevation region, and I chose the High Sierra California RAWS station (elevation = 2256 m). All stations are fairly proximal to one another, and roughly represent the middle elevation of their respective fire regions.\n",
